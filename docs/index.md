**LLLM** is a professional, production-ready framework for building advanced agentic systems. It emphasizes modularity, type safety, and neuro-symbolic capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Core abstractions, providers, tools, and memory are decoupled.
- **Type Safety**: Built on Pydantic for robust data validation and strict typing.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: First-class support for OpenAI, with extensible provider interface.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Design**: Advanced prompt management with structured output, exception handling, and interrupt logic.
- **Jupyter Sandbox**: Secure code execution environment for program synthesis.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install lllm
```
