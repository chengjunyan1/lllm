**LLLM** is a lightweight framework designed for researchers to fast-prototype advanced agentic systems. It emphasizes minimalism, modularity, and type safety, with first-class support for program synthesis and neuro-symbolic capabilities.

It is built to be the "PyTorch for Agents"—flexible, imperative, and easy to debug.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Core abstractions, providers, tools, and memory are decoupled.
- **Type Safety**: Built on Pydantic for robust data validation and strict typing.
- **Provider Interface**: First-class OpenAI support with an extensible interface for adding more providers.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Design**: Advanced prompt management with structured output, exception handling, and interrupt logic.
- **Jupyter Sandbox**: Secure code execution environment for program synthesis.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install lllm
```

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for more details.
