# {{project_name}} starter

This scaffold was generated by `lllm create --name {{project_name}}`.

Next steps:

1. Fill `config/{{project_name}}/default.yaml` with your actual model and logging settings.
2. Edit `system/agent/prompts/task.py` to describe your agent behaviour and outputs.
3. Review `system/proxy/modules/sample_proxy.py` and either remove it or replace it with real tool integrations.
4. Keep `lllm.toml` up to date if you add new prompt/proxy folders so auto-registration continues to work.

When you're ready, install dependencies and start building agents on top of this scaffold.
